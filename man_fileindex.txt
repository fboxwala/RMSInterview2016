fileindex.sh is a simple command line tool for calculating the top n words
in an arbitrary number of files.

Ensure that fileindex.sh is executable, and use as follows:

Usage: path/fileindex.sh [-n] path/FILE1 path/FILE2 ...

Where paths are the paths to fileindex.sh, and each file you wish to use in
the count.

    -n is an optional flag given to fileindex.sh specifying the number of 
    top n words you would like to calculate. When unspecified fileindex.sh 
    defaults to 10

Example:

`./fileindex.sh -7 book1.txt book2.txt book3.txt`
