how
was
she
to
bear
the
change
it
was
true
that
her
friend
was
going
only
half
a
mile
from
them
but
emma
was
aware
that
great
must
be
the
difference
between
a
mrs
weston
only
half
a
mile
from
them
and
a
miss
taylor
in
the
house
and
with
all
her
advantages
natural
and
domestic
she
was
now
in
great
danger
of
suffering
from
intellectual
solitude
she
dearly
loved
her
father
but
he
was
no
companion
for
her
he
could
not
meet
her
in
conversation
rational
or
playful
